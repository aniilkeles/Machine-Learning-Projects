# Machine-Learning-Projects
# My Machine Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of my personal path through the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. It’s where I document my learning process, turning complex theories into practical code.

## 📓 What's Inside?

This space acts as my digital laboratory and notebook. It is divided into two main parts:

* **The Learning Path:** Comprehensive lecture notes covering the math, logic, and intuition behind algorithms.
* **The Laboratory:** Hands-on projects where I apply what I've learned to real-world datasets—from basic regressions to advanced models.

## 🛠️ Toolbox

| Category | Tools & Libraries |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python |
| **Data** | Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn |
| **Visuals** | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
